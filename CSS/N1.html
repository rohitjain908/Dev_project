    <p class="sucess feedback">Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the   same markup page in different styles<a href="webite.com">this is website</a> for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by   voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has   rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]</p>
  
    <p class="error">Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that   is not contained in the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is :hover, which   identifies content only when the user "points to" the visible element, usually by holding the mouse   cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in a:hover or #elementid:hover. A pseudo-class   classifies document elements, such as :link or :visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that   may consist of partial elements, such as ::first-line or ::first-letter</p>

  </div>

  <p class="sucess" id="content">Selectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great specificity andflexibility.  [7] Multiple selectors may be joined in a spaced list to specify elements by location,element type, id,   class, or any combination thereof. The order of the selectors is important. Forexample, div .myClass   {color: red;} applies to all elements of class myClass that are inside divelements, whereas .myClass   div {color: red;} applies to all div elements that are inside elements of class myClass. This is not to   be confused with concatenated identifiers such as div.myClass {color:ed;} which applies to div   elements of class myClass.</p>

  

  <h2>Div Tag</h2>
  <div >Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup. All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to another file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML.</div>

  <div class="error">Before CSS, document authors who wanted to assign such typographic characteristics to, say, all h2 headings had to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type. This made documents more complex, larger, and more error-prone and difficult to maintain. CSS allows the separation of presentation from structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment, size, borders, spacing, layout and many other typographic characteristics, and can do so independently for on-screen and printed views. CSS also defines non-visual styles, such as reading speed and emphasis for aural text readers. The W3C has now deprecated the use of all presentational HTML markup</div>
